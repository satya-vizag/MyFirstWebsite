    <h3> "My favorite Book" </h3>

    <img src="../assets/img/book_cover.jpg" alt="Book Cover" width="200">
    <p> 
        My favorite book is <b> "The Fault in Our Stars" </b> written by "John Green". 
        I really like this book because the story revolves around a girl who's suffering
        from cancer and has no hope to live. The hero inspires her to love her life and it's pretty
        motivating. Basically never losing hope till the end and make the best of what you can.
